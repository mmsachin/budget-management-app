Steps to download download all files and folders from your frontend directory within Google Cloud Shell to your local Downloads folder

a. Go to the main folder
sachin_mm4u@cloudshell:~/budget-management-app

b. Zip the frontend Directory
zip -r frontend.zip frontend/

c. Create a Web Preview Link:

python3 -m http.server 8080

This starts a web server on port 8080, serving files from the current directory.

Now, click the "Web preview" button in the Cloud Shell toolbar.

Select "Preview on port 8080."

This will open a new browser tab or window showing the contents of your current directory. You should see frontend.zip listed.

d. Download the File:

In the web preview window, right-click on frontend.zip.
Select "Save link as..." (or a similar option, depending on your browser).
Choose your local Downloads folder as the destination.
Click "Save."
